      "validatedAnswer": "A",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To solve the equation 3x - 7 = 11, we first add 7 to both sides to isolate the term with x. This gives us: 3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7, which simplifies to 3x = 18. Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: 3x / 3 = 18 / 3, resulting in x = 6. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

      "storedAnswer": "B",
      "validatedAnswer": "B",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To solve the system of equations, we start with the two equations: 2x + 3y = 22 and x - y = 1. From the second equation, we can express x in terms of y: x = y + 1. We substitute this expression for x into the first equation: 2(y + 1) + 3y = 22. Expanding this gives us 2y + 2 + 3y = 22, which simplifies to 5y + 2 = 22. Subtracting 2 from both sides results in 5y = 20, and dividing by 5 gives us y = 4. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To solve the inequality 5 - 2x ≥ 11, we first subtract 5 from both sides: -2x ≥ 11 - 5, which simplifies to -2x ≥ 6. Next, we divide both sides by -2. Remember that when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality sign. Therefore, we get x ≤ -3. This means that the correct answer is A) x ≤ -3.",

      "validatedAnswer": "B",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To find the y-intercept of the line with slope -2 that passes through the point (1, 5), we can use the slope-intercept form of a line, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Here, m = -2. Substituting the point (1, 5) into the equation gives us: 5 = -2(1) + b. Simplifying this, we have: 5 = -2 + b. Adding 2 to both sides results in b = 7. Therefore, the y-intercept is 7, which corresponds to answer choice B.",

      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To model the total cost C of a ride that is m miles long, we need to account for both the initial fee and the cost per mile. The initial fee is $2.50, and the cost per mile is $1.75. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as: C = initial fee + (cost per mile * number of miles) = 2.50 + 1.75m. This can be rearranged to C = 1.75m + 2.50, which matches answer choice B.",

      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5, we can complete the square. First, we rewrite the quadratic: f(x) = (x^2 - 6x) + 5. Next, we take the coefficient of x, which is -6, halve it to get -3, and square it to get 9. We then add and subtract 9 inside the function: f(x) = (x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + 5 = (x - 3)^2 - 4. The vertex form of the quadratic is f(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 4, where the vertex is at (3, -4). Since this is a parabola that opens upwards, the minimum value occurs at the vertex, which is -4. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is -4, corresponding to answer choice A.",

      "validatedAnswer": "A",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 9x + 20 = 0, we can factor it. We need to find two numbers that multiply to 20 (the constant term) and add up to -9 (the coefficient of x). The numbers -4 and -5 satisfy these conditions because (-4) * (-5) = 20 and (-4) + (-5) = -9. Therefore, we can factor the equation as (x - 4)(x - 5) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions x = 4 and x = 5. Thus, the correct answer is A.",

      "subject": "math",
      "storedAnswer": "A",
      "validatedAnswer": "A",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "To determine the correct equation for g(x), we need to consider the properties given in the question. The graph intersects the x-axis at x = -2 and x = 6, which means these are the roots of the function. A quadratic function can be expressed in factored form as g(x) = a(x - r1)(x - r2), where r1 and r2 are the roots. Here, the roots are -2 and 6, so we can write the function as g(x) = a(x + 2)(x - 6). Since the graph opens upward, the leading coefficient 'a' must be positive. Therefore, the correct form is g(x) = (x + 2)(x - 6), which corresponds to answer choice A. Answer choice B has a negative leading coefficient, which would make the graph open downward, and choices C and D do not have the correct roots. Thus, the correct answer is A.",

      "validatedAnswer": "C",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "The bacteria population doubles every 6 hours. To find the population after 18 hours, we first determine how many 6-hour periods are in 18 hours. This is calculated as 18 hours divided by 6 hours per period, which equals 3 periods. Starting with an initial population of 1,200, we apply the doubling effect for each period: after 1 period (6 hours), the population is 1,200 × 2 = 2,400; after 2 periods (12 hours), it is 2,400 × 2 = 4,800; and after 3 periods (18 hours), it is 4,800 × 2 = 9,600. Therefore, the population after 18 hours is 9,600.",

      "storedAnswer": "A",
      "validatedAnswer": "A",
      "needsCorrection": false,
      "reasoning": "The medication decays by 15% each hour, which means that 85% of the medication remains after each hour. To express this mathematically, we can represent the remaining amount of medication after t hours as follows: \n\n1. Start with the initial amount: 80 milligrams. \n2. After 1 hour, 85% of the medication remains, which is calculated as 80 * 0.85. \n3. After 2 hours, the amount remaining would be 80 * 0.85 * 0.85, or 80 * (0.85)^2. \n4. Continuing this pattern, after t hours, the amount remaining is 80 * (0.85)^t. \n\nThus, the correct expression that gives the amount of medication after t hours is 80(0.85)^t, which corresponds to answer choice A.",
