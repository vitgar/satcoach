# Product Context: SAT Coach

## The Problem
High school students preparing for the SAT face several challenges:
1. **One-size-fits-all learning**: Traditional prep materials don't adapt to individual student needs
2. **Lack of immediate feedback**: Students often don't understand why answers are correct or incorrect
3. **Inefficient studying**: Without spaced repetition, students waste time on topics they've mastered
4. **Limited personalization**: Static materials can't adjust difficulty based on performance
5. **Expensive tutoring**: Personal SAT tutors are costly and not accessible to all students
