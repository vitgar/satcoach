AI Learning System Blueprint: Feynman + Bloom + Flow + Spaced Repetition
1. System Goals

Deep Understanding: Learners actively explain and refine concepts (Feynman).

Structured Cognitive Growth: Learning progresses through Bloom’s levels.

Optimal Engagement: Learners remain in Flow via adaptive challenge and feedback.

Long-Term Retention: Concepts are reinforced through staggered/spaced repetition.

Personalization: AI adapts difficulty, pacing, and exercises to each learner.

2. Key Modules
A. Content Module

Stores concepts, lessons, examples, and exercises.

Maps each concept to Bloom’s taxonomy levels.

Includes:

Text explanations

Visuals & diagrams

Interactive exercises (questions, mini-games, simulations)

Analogies & real-world applications

B. Learner Model Module

Tracks each learner’s:

Mastery level per concept

Time spent, accuracy, speed, and confidence

Feynman explanation quality (clarity, completeness, analogies)

Flow engagement indicators (pauses, retries, response patterns)

Drives adaptive difficulty, spaced repetition, and AI feedback.

C. AI Tutor / Coach Module

Role: Guides, monitors, evaluates, and motivates learners.

Capabilities:

Concept Explanation: Provides initial lesson content.

Active Prompting: Asks learner to explain, teach, or create analogies.

Feedback: Detects gaps, jargon, or misconceptions.

Adaptive Challenge: Adjusts exercises for Flow.

Spaced Repetition Scheduling: Determines when and how to revisit concepts.

Gamification: Provides streaks, levels, badges, mastery meters.

D. Flow Engine Module

Ensures learner stays in optimal challenge zone:

Monitors performance and engagement

Detects boredom or frustration

Adjusts difficulty, hints, or pacing

Suggests micro-breaks when needed

Uses real-time metrics: speed, accuracy, hesitation, skipped content.

E. Assessment & Reflection Module

Provides:

Formative assessments (quizzes, mini-projects)

Summative assessments (final projects, teaching exercises)

AI-generated prompts for reflection and analogies

Integrates Bloom’s higher levels (Analyze, Evaluate, Create) and Feynman refinement.

3. Learner Journey
Step	Technique Applied	Flow Integration	Bloom Level	Example
1. Introduction	AI explains concept	Clear goals, low initial challenge	Remember	“What is 1/4?”
2. Active Explanation	Learner teaches AI or virtual student	Focused task, intrinsic reward	Understand	Explain 1/4 using a pizza diagram
3. Gap Identification	AI detects unclear explanations	Micro-feedback maintains engagement	Analyze	AI highlights missing steps in explanation
4. Refinement	Learner revises explanation	Moderate challenge, intrinsic satisfaction	Evaluate	Learner adds analogy, draws diagram
5. Application	Learner solves problems	Slightly higher difficulty	Apply	“If 2 slices eaten, how much left?”
6. Synthesis	Learner creates new example	High engagement	Create	Design a mini “fraction game” for peers
7. Review	AI schedules spaced repetition	Optimal challenge for recall	Remember → Create	Recall, teach, and apply 1/4 and 1/3 over days/weeks
8. Reflection	Learner reflects on learning	Maintains Flow	Evaluate	“What was easiest? Hardest? Why?”
4. AI-Powered Spaced Repetition

Tracks time since last review, performance, and Flow metrics.

Determines next optimal review:

Short-term: hours → 1 day

Medium-term: 2–5 days

Long-term: 1–2 weeks or more

Incorporates progressive challenge:

Repeat in new contexts to reach Bloom’s higher levels

Always paired with active recall / Feynman-style teaching

5. Lesson Design Principles

Start with clarity: Explicit learning objectives (Flow + Bloom).

Active engagement: Require learner to explain, teach, or demonstrate (Feynman).

Adaptive challenge: Match task difficulty to skill to maintain Flow.

Immediate feedback: AI provides corrections and guidance instantly.

Incremental mastery: Bloom levels scaffolded within each concept.

Spaced repetition: Lessons revisit concepts at optimal intervals.

Reflection and synthesis: Encourage analogies, diagrams, and real-world applications.

Immersive interface: Minimize distractions, track engagement metrics.

6. Example UI / UX Features

Concept dashboard: Shows mastery level, upcoming reviews, and Flow status

Virtual student: Learner teaches; AI asks questions

Progress visualization: Mastery meter, streaks, badges

Interactive exercises: Drag-and-drop, simulations, mini-games

Adaptive hints: AI provides prompts when learner struggles

Flow feedback: Suggests breaks, micro-challenges, or harder problems

7. AI Technical Notes

NLP analysis: Evaluate learner explanations (clarity, completeness, analogies)

Adaptive scheduling algorithm: For Flow + spaced repetition

Performance metrics: Accuracy, response time, hesitation

Gamification engine: Track progress and motivation

Content generator: Analogies, explanations, exercises aligned with Bloom

This blueprint creates a holistic learning system where:

Feynman ensures active understanding,

Bloom provides structured cognitive progression,

Flow maximizes engagement,

Spaced repetition guarantees long-term retention,

AI personalizes and automates the process.
