### Session 1: Learning "Quadratic Equations"

**Time: Monday, 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM**

#### Step 1: Concept Introduction (5 minutes)
```
AI Tutor: "Good morning Alex! Today we're exploring quadratic equations. 
You're already strong with linear equations, so let's build on that. 
A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0. Notice the x² term - 
that's what makes it different from linear equations."

AI: "I'll give you a quick overview, then you'll explain it back to me."
[Brief explanation with 2 examples]
```

**Bloom Level**: Remember → Understand  
**Flow State**: Flow Zone (challenge: 7, skill: 9)  
**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard

---

#### Step 2: Active Explanation - Feynman Technique (8 minutes)

**Attempt 1:**
```
Alex: "So quadratic equations are like... they have a squared term, 
and they make a U-shaped graph called a parabola. You can solve them 
using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. 
The formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a."

AI Evaluation:
- Clarity: 85/100 ✓
- Completeness: 78/100 (missing discriminant discussion)
- Accuracy: 95/100 ✓
- Jargon Count: 4 (parabola, factoring, completing the square, discriminant)
- Bloom Level Demonstrated: Understand (Level 2)

AI Feedback: "Excellent start, Alex! Your explanation is clear and accurate. 
You mentioned the quadratic formula perfectly. To make it even better, 
could you explain what the discriminant (b² - 4ac) tells us about the solutions? 
Also, try using a simpler analogy - what's a real-world situation where 
something follows a quadratic pattern?"
```

**Attempt 2 (Refinement):**
```
Alex: "Okay, so quadratic equations create parabolas - like when you throw 
a ball, its path follows a quadratic curve. The discriminant tells us how 
many solutions we get: positive = 2 solutions, zero = 1 solution, negative = 
no real solutions. It's like... if you're trying to find where a ball hits 
the ground, the discriminant tells you if it will hit at all."

AI Evaluation:
- Clarity: 92/100 ✓✓
- Completeness: 88/100 ✓✓
- Accuracy: 97/100 ✓✓
- Jargon Count: 2 (appropriate for level)
- Analogies Used: 2 (ball throwing, hitting ground)
- Bloom Level Demonstrated: Apply (Level 3) - connecting to real world

### Session 1: Learning "Linear Equations"

**Time: Monday, 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM**

#### Step 1: Concept Introduction (8 minutes)
```
AI Tutor: "Hi Sam! Today we're working on linear equations. 
These are equations where the variable (like x) isn't squared. 
Let's start with a simple example: x + 5 = 12. 

[Visual: Balance scale showing equation]
[Step-by-step: subtract 5 from both sides]

Here's how we solve it step by step..."
[Detailed explanation with 3 examples]
```

**Bloom Level**: Remember  
**Flow State**: Flow Zone (challenge: 5, skill: 5)  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

#### Step 2: Active Explanation - Feynman Technique (12 minutes)

**Attempt 1:**
```
Sam: "Um, linear equations are... like when you have x plus something 
equals something else. And you solve it by doing the same thing to both sides. 
Like if you have x + 3 = 10, you subtract 3 from both sides and get x = 7."

AI Evaluation:
- Clarity: 65/100 (some hesitation)
- Completeness: 60/100 (missing "why" both sides)
- Accuracy: 75/100 (basic understanding)
- Jargon Count: 1 (appropriate)
- Bloom Level Demonstrated: Remember (Level 1)

AI Feedback: "Good start, Sam! You understand the basic steps. 
To make it clearer, can you explain WHY we do the same thing to both sides? 
Think about keeping a balance scale even."
```

**Attempt 2 (Refinement):**
```
Sam: "Oh, I see. It's like a balance scale - if you take something 
off one side, you have to take the same amount off the other side to 
keep it balanced. So if x + 3 = 10, we subtract 3 from both sides, 
and the scale stays balanced, and we get x = 7."

AI Evaluation:
- Clarity: 78/100 ✓ (improved!)
- Completeness: 75/100 ✓ (added why)
- Accuracy: 85/100 ✓✓
- Analogies Used: 1 (balance scale)
- Bloom Level Demonstrated: Understand (Level 2) - explains reasoning

AI Feedback: "Much better! Your balance scale analogy really helps. 
You've moved from just remembering the steps to understanding WHY they work. 
That's great progress! Ready to try some problems?"
```

**Flow State**: Flow Zone (challenge: 5, skill: 5) - good balance

#### Active Recall with Scaffolding
```
AI: "Sam, remember linear equations? Try explaining what we learned 
yesterday, then solve: 4x - 3 = 13"

Sam: "Linear equations are like balance scales. You do the same thing 
to both sides. For 4x - 3 = 13, I add 3 to both sides first, so 
4x = 16, then divide by 4, so x = 4."

AI: "Perfect! Your explanation is clearer now, and your solution is 
correct. Quality: 4/5 - great improvement!"
```

#### Application Review
```
AI: "Now try: 5x + 2 = 3x + 12. Remember, get all x terms on one side first."

Sam: "I subtract 3x from both sides, so 2x + 2 = 12, then subtract 2, 
so 2x = 10, so x = 5."

AI: "Excellent! You remembered the strategy. Quality: 4/5"
```

#### Gentle Progression
```
AI: "Great work! Now let's try a word problem: 'A number doubled and 
added to 5 equals 17. Find the number.'"

Sam: "Let x be the number. So 2x + 5 = 17. Subtract 5: 2x = 12. 
Divide by 2: x = 6."

AI: "Perfect! You're applying what you know to word problems now. 
Next review: 3 days, slightly harder problems"
